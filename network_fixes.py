This file contains fixes for network connection issues in the Expansion War game.

Instructions for modifying NetworkManager class:

1. Increase the client socket timeout on the server side:
   - In the method where you create and accept connections (likely in start_server or a similar method)
   - After accepting a client connection, set a longer timeout:
     client_socket.settimeout(30.0)  # 30 seconds instead of the default

2. Increase the sleep delay after sending the handshake response:
   - In the method where you send the initial handshake response to the client
   - After sending the handshake response, add a sleep:
     import time
     time.sleep(1.0)  # 1 second delay to ensure client has time to process

3. Add additional error handling for common socket errors:
   - In methods that handle socket operations, add specific handling for:
     - socket.error: 10054 (Connection reset by peer)
     - socket.error: 10053 (Software caused connection abort)
     - socket.error: 10060 (Connection timed out)

Example implementation:

```python
# In the server connection handling method
def handle_client_connection(self, client_socket, client_address):
    try:
        # Increase timeout
        client_socket.settimeout(30.0)
        
        # Send handshake
        # ...existing handshake code...
        
        # Add delay after handshake
        import time
        time.sleep(1.0)
        
        # Continue with connection processing
        # ...
    except socket.error as e:
        error_code = getattr(e, 'errno', None)
        if error_code in [10054, 10053, 10060]:
            self._handle_socket_disconnect(e, client_socket)
        else:
            raise
```

Note: The exact implementation will depend on how the NetworkManager class is structured.
